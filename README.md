# ConnectFour
Task: To create a Connect Four game using Java Swing and Object Oriented concepts using Java

Notes: 
- This was created with Java 8 code during my first year of learning Java, but is compiled and built with Java 15 with Maven from JDK 15.
- This project uses the maven-assembly-plugin to build a jar-with-dependencies, which is preferred over the normal jar.

Concepts Covered:
- Data Structures: Arrays,
- Variables and Scope: Strings, integers, and objects using public/private notation and inheritance
- Java Swing: JFrame, JPanel, JButtons, JTextArea, JLabel, JScrollPanes, and Paint methods
- Comments: Functionality of user-created methods and lines included
